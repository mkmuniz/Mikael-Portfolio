                        I'm Mikael from SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. I discovered my passion for
                        programming at the age of 12 and have been dedicated to
                        learning ever since. I pursued my interest by becoming a
                        System Development Student at Mackenzie University in 2020.
                        During that time, I secured my first internship at the MackLeaps
                        Laboratory, where I gained valuable experience over two years.
                        In 2022, I transitioned from an intern to a Full Stack Junior
                        Developer at the same laboratory. My journey continued as I
                        joined Sossego Consultoria in 2023, this time as a Back-End
                        Junior Developer. After contributing until August 2023, I am now
                        actively seeking new opportunities to further enhance my skills
                        and advance my career.
